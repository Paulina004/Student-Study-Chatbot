## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** (recommended: 3.10 or 3.11)
- **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** (for running local LLMs, e.g., qwen2.5:14b)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/study-companion-chatbot.git
cd study-companion-chatbot
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install and Start Ollama

- [Download and install Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)
- Pull the suggested model (e.g., qwen2.5:14b):

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:14b
ollama serve  # If not started automatically
```

---

## Configuration

- **No environment variables are strictly required for local use.**
- By default, all uploaded files and vector indices are stored in a local `data/` directory.
- If you wish to change the model or embedding backend, edit the `init_llm` and `init_embeddings` functions in `models.py`.

---

## Running the Application

From the project root directory, run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

- The app will open in your default web browser using localhost.
- Upload your study materials using the sidebar, then interact with the chatbot in the main window.

---

## Usage Examples

- **Ask a Question (Default Mode):**  
  Type a question about your uploaded notes, e.g.,  
  _"What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?"_

- **Summarize a Topic:**  
  Click the "Summarize" button, then enter a topic, e.g.,  
  _"Summarize neural networks"_

- **Take a Quiz:**  
  Click the "Quiz" button, enter a topic, and follow the prompts to take a multiple-choice quiz.

- **Track Progress:**  
  View your topic mastery in the sidebar.

## Known Limitations

- **Local-Only:** The app is designed for local use and requires Ollama and FAISS. It does not support cloud-based LLMs or vector stores out of the box.
- **Model Support:** Only models available via Ollama and HuggingFace are supported. You may need to adjust code for other models.
- **File Size:** Large files may slow down processing or exceed memory limits.
- **No User Authentication:** All data is stored locally; there is no user management or cloud sync.
- **Token Limits:** Very large documents or queries may hit LLM context window limits.
- **Reference and Similarity Limitations:** The chatbot uses free/open models for both language and embeddings. Sometimes, the model may make mistakes with references, or the similarity search may not always retrieve the most relevant context. This is a limitation of current free, local open-source models and embedding methods.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Security:** All processing is local; your documents are never uploaded to a server.
- **Extensibility:** The codebase is modular—add new workflows, models, or UI components as needed.
- **Support:** For issues or questions, please open an issue on GitHub or contact the maintainer, [Paulina004](https://github.com/Paulina004).
