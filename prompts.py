# Common formatting instructions
HTML_FORMATTING_RULES = """
You MUST strictly follow these formatting rules. No exceptions:
1. Use HTML and markdown formatting correctly:
   - Main topics: <h2> tags
   - Subtopics: <h3> tags
   - Bullet points: <ul> and <li> tags
   - Important terms: <strong> tags
   - Citations: use <sup>[X]</sup> format, where X is the source number.
2. Every factual statement must have a citation. No citation = plagiarism.
3. Break complex explanations into clear, short sections.
4. Keep paragraphs short and easy to read.
5. At the end, include a "References" section:
   - List ALL sources cited.
   - Use numbered format, matching the order of citations in your answer.
   - For slides, format references as: <From _.pptx>.
   - For PDFs, format references as: <From _.pdf>.
6. NEVER invent citations. Only use what is given in the context.
